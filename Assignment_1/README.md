# Task
Given a scaffold including four classes: KinderKit,  DrawingCanvas, Triangle, and Rectangle.  KinderKit.java will be the main application containing the main() method. The other three classes will contain methods for setting up the drawing canvas (DrawingCanvas.java), handling user inputs (e.g., information of the shapes to be drawn), and drawing the supported shapes (Triangle.java and Rectangle.java). All these .java files are almost empty and the programmer is asked to add constructors, instance variables, and methods to complete the program.

# How to run
With the repo clonned running the comand `javac * && java KinderKit width height char` in a terminal, where `width` is the width of the canvas, `height` the height of the canvas and `char` the background character of the canvas, the program will run and the user has to follow the stepts to interact.

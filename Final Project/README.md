# Task
Your company has recently built a fleet of autonomous robots that can assist in rescue operations during natural disasters, such as bushfires and floods. RescueBots' robots can navigate unknown terrain and successfully locate and rescue people in need of help. For these robots to be truly autonomous and effective, however, they must be capable of making difficult decisions. The RescueBots robots must be programmed to prioritize and determine the order of rescue operations, a feat with ethical and moral implications.

In this project, the programmer is asked to create the decision engine for RescueBots, i.e., a program designed to explore different scenarios and make critical decisions about whom to save. The programmer will finally audit the decision-making algorithm through simulations, and allow users of the program to judge the outcomes themselves.

# How to run
You must run the following command:
1.  `javac *.java && java RescueBot --scenarios path/to/scenarios.csv` or `javac *.java && java RescueBot -s path/to/scenarios.csv` to run the program and start interacting with the scenarios.   


2. `javac *.java && java -h` to print the help menu.
